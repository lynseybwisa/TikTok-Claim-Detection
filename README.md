# TikTok-Claim-Detection
Efficient Comment Classification for TikTok: A machine learning project to automatically distinguish user claims from opinions in TikTok comments, enhancing content moderation and user reporting.

# Description
This project aims to develop a predictive model for classifying user comments on TikTok as either claims or opinions. The goal is to improve content moderation and enhance the platform's ability to prioritize user reports efficiently.

TikTok users have the ability to report videos and comments that contain user claims. These reports identify content that needs to be reviewed by moderators. This process generates a large number of user reports that are difficult to address quickly. 

TikTok is working on the development of a predictive model that can determine whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion. With a successful prediction model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently.
